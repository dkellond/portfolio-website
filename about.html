      <h2> About </h2>
      <h4>
        <p> My name is David Kellond and I'm a UX/UI Designer from Denver, Colorado. I have skills in working with Sketch, Invision, Creative Cloud, as well as being proficient in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. When I'm not sitting behind my Macbook looking smart, I'm drinking incredible Colorado
        beer, playing music with friends, or spending time with my beautiful family.
        My focus is on designing products and systems that will create delight and alleviate frustration for the people who use them.
        I have an extensive background in human services,
        which has given me particular insight and empathy for people and an appreciation for making data-informed design decisions to create the best possible solution to help empower people to overcome their problems. I am ready to join a team who shares a congruent passion for designing products that will change peoples lives. </p>
